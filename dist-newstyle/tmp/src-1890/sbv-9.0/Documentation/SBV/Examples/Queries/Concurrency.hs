-- When we would like to solve a set of related problems we can use query mode
-- to perform push's and pop's. However performing a push and a pop is still
-- single threaded and so each solution will need to wait for the previous
-- solution to be found. In this example we show a class of functions
-- 'Data.SBV.satConcurrentAll' and 'Data.SBV.satConcurrentAny' which spin up
-- independent solver instances and runs query computations concurrently. The
-- children query computations are allowed to communicate with one another as
-- demonstrated in the second demo

-- | Find all solutions to @x + y .== 10@ for positive @x@ and @y@, but at each
-- iteration we would like to ensure that the value of @x@ we get is at least
-- twice as large as the previous one. This is rather silly, but demonstrates
-- how we can dynamically query the result and put in new constraints based on
-- those.

-- | In our first query we'll define a constraint that will not be known to the
-- shared or second query and then solve for an answer that will differ from the
-- first query. Note that we need to pass an MVar in so that we can operate on
-- the shared variables. In general, the variables you want to operate on should
-- be defined in the shared part of the query and then passed to the children
-- queries via channels, MVars, or TVars. In this query we constrain x to be
-- less than y and then return the sum of the values. We add a threadDelay just
-- for demonstration purposes

-- search space, then waiting for more information, once it gets that
-- information it will run a completely separate computation from the first one
-- and return its results.

-- it happens in shared.
